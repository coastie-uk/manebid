# ManeBid

**Convention Auction Manager**

Web platform to collect, manage, present, record bids and take payment for items at the kind of auctions often encountered at fan conventions. The use case may vary slightly from con to con, but generally looks like this:

- Attendees submit items before / during the event
- A live auction is held, using a slide deck to show items
- Attendees bid on items by holding up a paddle card
- Attendees pay for and collect their won items.

This software provides a single platform which automates the process from item submission through to payment. This now includes integration with the SumUp merchant platform allowing payments to be taken and recorded through the platform.

## Features

- Public item submission (with optional photo) & QR code support
- Admin panel to add, edit, delete, and manage items, including image rotate/crop
- Bid recording view with undo function
- Cashier panel to record payments
- Integration with SumUp supporting web hosted checkouts and app payments with a card reader.
- Maintenance tools: manage auctions, logs, auditing, import/export, auto-create test items, etc.
- User accounts with username/password login, per-user roles, and extra scoped permissions
- Automatic PowerPoint generation from custom templates (slide deck + item cards)
- Printing of receipt-style item slips
- Auto-updating slideshow for in-venue advertising
- Automatic randomised item & bid generators (for testing/training/evaluation)
- Mobile-friendly interfaces
